# vimrc
My .vimrc backup including some plugins installed and managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Also works with Neovim without aditional configuration.

## Installation prerequisites
- An Unix-like operating system
- git
- vim-plug (link above)

## Running prerequisites
- neovim or vim 7.5+ (remove "set termguicolors" inside **.vimrc** in case you use a older version)

### Optionals
- Meslo Nerd Font (for the correct display of the slanted separators for the [lightline plugin](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim))

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/vhborges/vimrc.git
cd vimrc
./install.sh
```
